sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: This sort has highest runtime for reversed and random lists, i.e worst case scenarios. But it has lowest runtime for sorted lists, i.e best case scenarios. Also, the runtime for unsorted lists is much higher than the runtime for sorted list(Big O > Omega).Hence sort1 is bubble sort.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: This sort has least runtimes for unsorted lists and has second least runtime for sorted lists. Also, it has almost similar runtimes for sorted and unsorted lists(Big O = Omega).Hence sort2 is merge sort.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: This sort has second least runtime for unsorted lists and the highest runtime for sorted lists. Also, it has almost similar runtimes for sorted and unsorted lists(Big O = Omega). Hence sort3 is selection sort.
